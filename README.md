# hollows-vtt-unofficial
A thrown-together Hollows roll20 sheet for playing online.
This is an UNOFFICIAL SHEET made so I can DM the Hollows playtest through roll20, a virtual tabletop, with a minimum of CSS and a lot of hacked together solutions. 
Feel free to modify it as you see fit.

Hollows is an upcoming tabletop RPG made by Rowan, Rook and Decard. You can learn more about the playtest <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/Hollows-resources/">here.</a>

HOW TO USE: 
- YOU WILL NEED TO BE A PRO USER IN ROLL20 FOR THIS
- select Custom in the character sheet template dropdown
- Copy the hollowsheet.html file (this one) into the HTML tab
- Copy the hollowsheet.css file into the CSS tab
- Save changes
-You're done!
